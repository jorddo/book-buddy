# Book Buddy

## Description

Book Buddy is a search engine for books, built with Google Books API. Originally a RESTFul project, I cloned the original repo and have converted it to be GraphQL.

- I built did the work on this project so that I could better understand the differences between these two types of API implementation
- I learned a lot about GraphQL and MongoDB. I was able to continue learning React on the front end, and Apollo Server on the back. I also emjoyed learning about how to modify the authentication middleware so that it could work in the context of a GraphQL API.
